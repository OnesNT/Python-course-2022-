Vasya and Petya are trying to harden the computer in the accounts department of the shark.olymp service. They come up with a new complex password for the computer. The guys consider the password difficult if it contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter and at least one number. However, the accountant Zinaida Markovna cannot remember the password if it contains more than 3 digits and it is longer than 10 characters.

To optimize the search, the guys asked you to write a program that checks if the password is strong and if Zinaida Markovna can remember it.




Input format
The input.txt file is given, which contains one line consisting of Latin letters and numbers, no longer than 30. There is no newline character at the end.

Output format
Output two lines to the output.txt file. In the first one, type YES if the password is considered complex, and NO otherwise. In the second, type YES if Zinaida Markovna can remember the password, and NO otherwise.
