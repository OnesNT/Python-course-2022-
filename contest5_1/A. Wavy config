On the computer of the system administrator Pakhom, out of nowhere, a virus started arbitrarily changing the case of letters. Vasya and Petya tried to give a nice name to the file with the settings of the printer for accounting, but because of the virus they failed. They decided to write a program that would align the case of the letters in the name so that even-numbered letters were uppercase and odd-numbered letters were lowercase. Help them!
