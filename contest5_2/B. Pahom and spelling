Sysadmin Pahom is not friendly with spelling and constantly forgets the rule "Жи-ши is written with И". Vasya and Petya decided to help him and write a program that draws a large rectangle that consists of the letters И. They plan to embed it in a text editor to remind Pakhom about spelling. Help them!




Input format
You are given two integers separated by a newline. 1 ≤ a ≤ 15, 1 ≤ b ≤ 15.

Output format
Print a rectangle of size a rows and b columns, made up of the letters И, as in the example. There must be exactly one space between letters in a string. Exactly one line of spaces of the same length as the rest of the lines must be printed between lines.
