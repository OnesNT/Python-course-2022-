Accountant Zinaida Markovna is very afraid that her quarterly report will be ruined by hackers. She asked the sysadmin Pakhom to protect the file with a password. Pakhom loves the number 3 very much, so he generated a positive integer with exactly three digits 3 as a password. Unfortunately, Zinaida Markovna lost a piece of paper with a password, and Pakhom remembers only that he was the i-th number with exactly three threes. Help them open the file.



Input format
